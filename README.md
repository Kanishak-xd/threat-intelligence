## Design Planning

We designed our UI/UX using Figma to visualize the user flow and layout. Focus was placed on dark theme & usability.

## DevOps & CI/CD

We implemented DevOps practices to streamline development and deployment.

- **Docker** was used to containerize frontend and backend for local development.
- **Jenkins** handled CI/CD automation, auto-deploying on GitHub pushes.
- **.env** configuration supported local, Netlify, Render, and Jenkins builds.

### Docker Containers (Frontend & Backend)

## Lighthouse Report

We ran a Lighthouse audit on the deployed application to assess its performance and quality.

| Category       | Score |
|----------------|-------|
| Performance    | 62    |
| Accessibility  | 98    |
| Best Practices | 96    |
| SEO            | 100   |

> Audited using Chrome DevTools in Desktop mode

### What We Learned

- While our scores in accessibility, best practices, and SEO were strong, we identified room for improvement in performance.
- Key issues included heavy JavaScript, unoptimized images, and blocking main-thread work.
- From this audit, we learned the importance of optimizing assets, reducing bundle sizes, and improving load efficiency — insights we'll apply to future projects for a better user experience.
